        "### 1. Explain the concept of portals in React and describe how they differ from regular DOM rendering.\n",
        "  - In React, portals are a way to render a component’s content into a different place in the DOM than its parent component.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Normally, when we write JSX inside a component, React puts it inside the DOM tree right where the component is placed. But with portals, we can tell React to render that content somewhere else in the DOM, even if it’s not a direct child of the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "  For example, we can use portals to show modals, pop-ups, or tooltips that need to appear on top of everything, outside the normal component structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Difference from regular DOM rendering:\n",
        "    * Regular rendering → React puts the elements inside the DOM hierarchy of the parent.\n",
        "    * Portals → React puts the elements in a different DOM node (outside the parent), but they still work the same in terms of React’s event handling and state.\n",
        "\n",
        "  It’s like placing a TV in another room, but still controlling it with the same remote.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Create a simple React component that uses a portal to render a modal dialog. Ensure that the modal can be opened and closed using state management.\n",
        "  * [Live link](https://manish99verma.github.io/react-portal-modal/)\n",

        "### 3. What is React Fiber, and what are its primary goals? Discuss how it improves the reconciliation process compared to previous versions of React.\n",
        "- React Fiber is the new engine (or architecture) inside React, introduced in React 16, that handles how React updates the UI. It’s basically a complete rewrite of React’s core to make rendering more flexible and smoother.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Primary goals of React Fiber:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Smooth UI updates – make sure animations, gestures, and interactions feel fast.\n",
        "  * Pause and resume rendering – React can stop work in the middle, handle something important, and then continue.\n",
        "  * Split work into smaller parts – instead of doing all rendering in one go, Fiber breaks it into chunks.\n",
        "  * Better handling of asynchronous rendering – updates don’t block the main thread for too long.\n",
        "\n",
        "  How it improves reconciliation compared to old React:\n",
        "  * Old React (Stack Reconciler) → worked in one big step. Once it started updating the UI, it couldn’t stop until it was done. This sometimes made the UI freeze for big updates.\n",
        "  * React Fiber → works in small units of work and can decide which updates are more important. It can pause low-priority work and focus on high-priority tasks like user typing or animations.\n",
        "   \n",
        "  In short, Fiber makes React’s UI updates faster, smoother, and more responsive by making rendering interruptible and prioritized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is React Suspense? Explain its purpose in managing asynchronous operations in React applications. Write a simple example to illustrate suspense in React\n",
        "- React Suspense is a feature in React that lets you wait for something (like data or code) before showing a component. Instead of showing an empty screen or broken UI, Suspense lets you display a fallback (like a loading spinner) until the component is ready.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Purpose in managing asynchronous operations:\n",
        "  * Helps handle lazy loading of components or data smoothly.\n",
        "  * Shows a fallback UI while waiting for something to load.\n",
        "  * Makes code cleaner by avoiding complex “loading” state logic in every component.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This examples shows a fallback ui as loading text until it loads the about component.\n",
        "\n",
        "  App.jsx\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  import React, { Suspense, lazy } from \"react\";\n",
        "\n",
        "  // Lazy load the component\n",
        "  const About = lazy(() => import(\"./About\"));\n",

        "### 5. List and explain at least five best practices for optimizing performance in React applications. Provide examples where applicable.\n",
        "- Five Best Practices for Optimizing Performance in React\n",
        "  1. Use React.memo for Component Re-render Control\n",
        "    * React.memo stops a functional component from re-rendering if its props haven’t changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    const Button = React.memo(function Button({ onClick }) {\n",
        "      console.log(\"Rendered\");\n",
        "      return <button onClick={onClick}>Click</button>;\n",
        "    });\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    This prevents unnecessary re-renders.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Use useCallback and useMemo Hooks\n",
        "    * useCallback keeps the same function reference between renders.\n",
        "    * useMemo stores a calculated value so it doesn’t get recalculated every time.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n",
        "      console.log(\"Clicked\");\n",
        "    }, []);\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  \n",
        "  3. Code Splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`\n",
        "    * Loads parts of your app only when needed (reduces initial load time).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    const About = React.lazy(() => import(\"./About\"));\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Avoid Anonymous Functions in JSX\n",
        "    * Anonymous functions in JSX create a new function on every render, which can cause unnecessary updates.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Exmaple:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    <button onClick={() => doSomething()}>Click</button> // Bad practice\n",
        "    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>         // Good practice\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    \n",
        "  5. Use List Keys Properly\n",
        "    * Keys help React identify which items have changed, improving rendering speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    {items.map(item => <li>{item}</li>)} // Bad Practice\n",
        "    {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)} // Good practice\n",
